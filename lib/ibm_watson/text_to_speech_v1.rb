# ### Service Overview
# The IBM&reg; Text to Speech service provides APIs that use IBM's speech-synthesis
# capabilities to synthesize text into natural-sounding speech in a variety of languages,
# dialects, and voices. The service supports at least one male or female voice, sometimes
# both, for each language. The audio is streamed back to the client with minimal delay.
#
# For speech synthesis, the service supports a synchronous HTTP Representational State
# Transfer (REST) interface. It also supports a WebSocket interface that provides both
# plain text and SSML input, including the SSML &lt;mark&gt; element and word timings.
# SSML is an XML-based markup language that provides text annotation for speech-synthesis
# applications.
#
# The service also offers a customization interface. You can use the interface to define
# sounds-like or phonetic translations for words. A sounds-like translation consists of
# one or more words that, when combined, sound like the word. A phonetic translation is
# based on the SSML phoneme format for representing a word. You can specify a phonetic
# translation in standard International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) representation or in the
# proprietary IBM Symbolic Phonetic Representation (SPR).

    # Synthesize audio.
    # Synthesizes text to audio that is spoken in the specified voice. The service bases
    #   its understanding of the language for the input text on the specified voice. Use a
    #   voice that matches the language of the input text.
    #
    #   The service returns the synthesized audio stream as an array of bytes. You can
    #   pass a maximum of 5 KB of text to the service.
    #
    #   **See also:** [Synthesizing text to
    #   audio](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/text-to-speech/http.html#synthesize).
    #
    #   ### Audio formats (accept types)
    #
    #    The service can return audio in the following formats (MIME types).
    #   * Where indicated, you can optionally specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the
    #   audio. You must specify a sampling rate for the `audio/l16` and `audio/mulaw`
    #   formats. A specified sampling rate must lie in the range of 8 kHz to 192 kHz.
    #   * For the `audio/l16` format, you can optionally specify the endianness
    #   (`endianness`) of the audio: `endianness=big-endian` or
    #   `endianness=little-endian`.
    #
    #   Use the `Accept` header or the `accept` parameter to specify the requested format
    #   of the response audio. If you omit an audio format altogether, the service returns
    #   the audio in Ogg format with the Opus codec (`audio/ogg;codecs=opus`). The service
    #   always returns single-channel audio.
    #   * `audio/basic`
    #
    #     The service returns audio with a sampling rate of 8000 Hz.
    #   * `audio/flac`
    #
    #     You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is
    #   22,050 Hz.
    #   * `audio/l16`
    #
    #     You must specify the `rate` of the audio. You can optionally specify the
    #   `endianness` of the audio. The default endianness is `little-endian`.
    #   * `audio/mp3`
    #
    #     You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is
    #   22,050 Hz.
    #   * `audio/mpeg`
    #
    #     You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is
    #   22,050 Hz.
    #   * `audio/mulaw`
    #
    #     You must specify the `rate` of the audio.
    #   * `audio/ogg`
    #
    #     The service returns the audio in the `vorbis` codec. You can optionally specify
    #   the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is 22,050 Hz.
    #   * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
    #
    #     You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is
    #   22,050 Hz.
    #   * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
    #
    #     You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is
    #   22,050 Hz.
    #   * `audio/wav`
    #
    #     You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is
    #   22,050 Hz.
    #   * `audio/webm`
    #
    #     The service returns the audio in the `opus` codec. The service returns audio
    #   with a sampling rate of 48,000 Hz.
    #   * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
    #
    #     The service returns audio with a sampling rate of 48,000 Hz.
    #   * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
    #
    #     You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is
    #   22,050 Hz.
    #
    #   For more information about specifying an audio format, including additional
    #   details about some of the formats, see [Specifying an audio
    #   format](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/text-to-speech/http.html#format).
    #
    #   ### Warning messages
    #
    #    If a request includes invalid query parameters, the service returns a `Warnings`
    #   response header that provides messages about the invalid parameters. The warning
    #   includes a descriptive message and a list of invalid argument strings. For
    #   example, a message such as `\"Unknown arguments:\"` or `\"Unknown url query
    #   arguments:\"` followed by a list of the form `\"{invalid_arg_1},
    #   {invalid_arg_2}.\"` The request succeeds despite the warnings.
    # @param text [String] The text to synthesize.
    # @param accept [String] The requested format (MIME type) of the audio. You can use the `Accept` header or
    #   the `accept` parameter to specify the audio format. For more information about
    #   specifying an audio format, see **Audio formats (accept types)** in the method
    #   description.
    #
    #   Default: `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`.
    # @param voice [String] The voice to use for synthesis.
    # @param customization_id [String] The customization ID (GUID) of a custom voice model to use for the synthesis. If a
    #   custom voice model is specified, it is guaranteed to work only if it matches the
    #   language of the indicated voice. You must make the request with service
    #   credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model.
