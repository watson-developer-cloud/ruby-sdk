    # @!method initialize(args)
    # Construct a new client for the Assistant service.
    #
    # @param args [Hash] The args to initialize with
    # @option args version [String] The API version date to use with the service, in
    #   "YYYY-MM-DD" format. Whenever the API is changed in a backwards
    #   incompatible way, a new minor version of the API is released.
    #   The service uses the API version for the date you specify, or
    #   the most recent version before that date. Note that you should
    #   not programmatically specify the current date at runtime, in
    #   case the API has been updated since your application's release.
    #   Instead, specify a version date that is compatible with your
    #   application, and don't change it until your application is
    #   ready for a later version.
    # @option args url [String] The base url to use when contacting the service (e.g.
    #   "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/assistant/api").
    #   The base url may differ between Bluemix regions.
    # @option args username [String] The username used to authenticate with the service.
    #   Username and password credentials are only required to run your
    #   application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on
    #   Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the
    #   `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
    # @option args password [String] The password used to authenticate with the service.
    #   Username and password credentials are only required to run your
    #   application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on
    #   Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the
    #   `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
    # @option args iam_apikey [String] An API key that can be used to request IAM tokens. If
    #   this API key is provided, the SDK will manage the token and handle the
    #   refreshing.
    # @option args iam_access_token [String] An IAM access token is fully managed by the application.
    #   Responsibility falls on the application to refresh the token, either before
    #   it expires or reactively upon receiving a 401 from the service as any requests
    #   made with an expired token will fail.
    # @option args iam_url [String] An optional URL for the IAM service API. Defaults to
    #   'https://iam.ng.bluemix.net/identity/token'.
